<H3>Description </H3>
This is the Cygnus wall -- part of NGC 7000, North American Nebula

<p>
This image was taken with iTelescope. Rather than taking with the image in color, the image was captured narow band filters (Hydrogen alpha, Sulphur and Oxygen) and the images mapped to color using the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/behind_the_pictures/">Hubble Color Palette</a> &ndash; the sulphur signal was mapped to red, hydrogen alpa to red and oxygen to blue. 
<p>
The co-ordinates for this capture were: RA = 20:59:31 ; Dec= 43&deg; 38&apos; 27&quot;
