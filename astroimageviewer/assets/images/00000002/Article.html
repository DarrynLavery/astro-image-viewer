<H3>Description </H3>
This image was taken with iTelescope. Rather than taking with the image in color, the image was captured narow band filters (Hydrogen alpha, Sulphur and Oxygen) and the images mapped to color using the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/behind_the_pictures/">Hubble Color Palette</a> &ndash; the sulphur signal was mapped to red, hydrogen alpa to red and oxygen to blue. 

<H3>Equipment</H3>
iTelescope T121

	<li>Telescope:Planewave 17" CDK</li>
	<li>CCD: FLI-PL6303E </li>
	<li>Mount: Planewave Ascension 200HR -</li>
	<li>Filters: Astrodon 5nm Ha, SII and OIII</li>

April / May 2016
<H3>Data</H3>
<p>
Final data consisted of:
<ul>
	<li>Ha: 6 * 10 mins</li>
	<li>OIII: 6 * 10 mins at bin 2</li>
 	<li>SII: 6 * 10 mins at bin 2</li>
 </ul>

<H3>Processing notes</H3>

Processing of the data was achieved with PixInsight, LightRoom and Photoshop. As the sulphur and oxygen signals were weak, the signals were 'boosted' using software binning (summing groups of pixels). Assignment of colors done with Hubble Color Palette: SII mapped to red, Ha mapped to Green and OIII mapped to blue.
