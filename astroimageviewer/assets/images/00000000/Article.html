This is NGC 7000 with the Cygnus wall and Pelican Nebula
In order to accomodate the Cygnus Wall and IC 5070 (Pelican Nebula), the following custom co-ordinates were used: RA = 20:55:00; Dec = 44&deg; 12&apos; 00&quot;

This image has been cropped and rotated to better show both of these objects.



<H3>Equipment</H3>

iTelescope T14 
<ul>
	<li>Telescope: OTA: Takahashi FSQ Fluorite 106mm</li>
	<li>CCD: SBIG STL-11000M</li>
	<li>Mount: Paramount GT-1100S</li>
	<li>Filters: Astrodon 5nm Ha, SII and OIII</li>
</ul>

<H3>Data</H3>
<p>
Final data consisted of:
<ul>
	<li>Ha: 6  * 10 mins</li>
	<li>OIII: 7 * 10 mins at bin 2</li>
 	<li>SII: 7 * 10 mins at bin 2</li>
 </ul>

<H2>Processing notes</H2>

Processing of the data was achieved with PixInsight, LightRoom and Photoshop. As the sulphur and oxygen signals were weak, the signals were 'boosted' using software binning (summing groups of pixels). Assignment of colors done with Hubble Color Palette: SII mapped to red, Ha mapped to Green and OIII mapped to blue.
